# <Prework-Study-Guide>

## Description
- Going into the world of coding to have a change of career path, this webpage has helped me start the process.
- Building this webpage is able to bring me further along into the process of stepping into the vast world of coding, and it was important to start with this webpage and its contents.
- In order to go through with this making this webpage it required for me to take down multiple pages of notes and guidelines, in order to organize all of the notes into something remotely understandable this webpage was created.
- What did you learn? While creating the organizing webpage I was able to learn how to work the command line and find my way through various directories and commits that needed to be done. I also learned some valuable lessons of how to debug my code lines so they wouldn't create errors.
## Installation

In the creation of the project itself, it should be noted that every step is done with a safe backup to ensure that every single digit worked int he correct manner of events. However, the step by step construction involves a multitude of steps that are relatively easy for any beginner to understand and work through as they continue along.

## Usage

To use this Prework Study Guide, you can review the notes in each section. For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
